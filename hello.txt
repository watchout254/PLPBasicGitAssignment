"Hello git,, it's mukenya here my g."

I've used the following steps: 
Created a new repo on github. 
Created a new folder on my local machine.
using the CMD, i navigated to the created folder
In my Vs code, i created a new file hello.txt, added some content there.
Opened a new terminal and initialized a git repository
>>>>Git init
>>>> Git add remote origin ...................
>>>>Git add hello.txt
>>>>Git commit -m "Add hello.txt ................"
>>>>Git push -u origin master since main brings up an error

Head over to the readme section see some snips. Lovely
